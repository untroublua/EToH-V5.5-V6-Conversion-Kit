# CAUTION: SCRIPTS MAY BE UNSTABLE!! MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED

These are the legacy scripts, made before the full converter begun development
I've come to discover that they're extremely buggy and unreliable, but they are good for individually converting one type of client object
I might consider updating these scripts and adding support for more client objects, but it's not guaranteed.
